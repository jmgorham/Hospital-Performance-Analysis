These insights will then be leveraged to generate recommendations for hospital administration. \n\nThis project uses synthetic data. The dataset used for analysis contains weekly aggregated service-level data for a fictional hospital over the course of one year. The hospital offers four services: emergency, general medicine, ICU, and surgery. Each row in the dataset represents a single service for a single week.\n\nThis analysis will focus on the following four key performance metrics:\n\n1. Bed Utilization Rate\n2. Patients Refused Services\n3. Patient Satisfaction\n4. Staff Morale\n\nThis analysis will explore how these metrics vary across hospital services throughout the year and the impact of events.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Initial Data Exploration\n\nIn preparing the data, we add the following columns:\n\n* percent_patients_refused: percent of patients who request services and are refused services\n* utilization_rate: percent of beds occupied\n* utilization_level: categorizes utilization_rate as low, ideal, high, or critical\n    * low: utilization_rate less than 0.7\n    * ideal: utilization_rate between 0.7 and 0.85\n    * high: utilization_rate between 0.85 and 1.0\n    * critical: utilization_rate of exactly 1.0\n\nThese utilization levels were chosen for multiple reasons. A utilization rate of 85% is commonly considered a critical threshold (see [Bagust et al., BMJ 1999](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.319.7203.155)). Utilization above 85% may cause a significant strain on hospital resources. A utilization rate of 100% indicates that the hospital is at maximum capacity. Conversely, a low utilization rate may indicate inefficient allocation of resources and result in lower profit.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# SET UP ENVIRONMENT\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nlist.files(path = \"../input\")\n\n# LOAD AND PREPARE DATA\n\nservices_weekly <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/hospital-beds-management/services_weekly.csv\")\n\nservices_weekly <- services_weekly %>%\n    mutate(percent_patients_refused = patients_refused / patients_request,\n           utilization_rate = patients_admitted / available_beds,\n           utilization_level = cut(utilization_rate,\n                                  breaks = c(0, 0.7, 0.85, 1, Inf),\n                                  labels = c(\"low\", \"ideal\", \"high\", \"critical\"),\n                                  right = FALSE))\n\nhead(services_weekly)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-05T21:31:42.028541Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-05T21:31:42.035261Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-05T21:31:43.595710Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-05T21:31:43.594220Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We begin the initial data exploration by visualizing trends in all four key metrics over the course of the year.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# TIME SERIES OF KEY METRICS\n\nservices_weekly %>%\n    select(service, utilization_rate, percent_patients_refused,\n           patient_satisfaction, staff_morale, month) %>%\n    group_by(service, month) %>%\n    summarise(\"Utilization Rate (monthly avg)\" = mean(utilization_rate),\n              \"Patients Refused (monthly avg percent)\" = mean(percent_patients_refused),\n              \"Patient Satisfaction (monthly avg)\" = mean(patient_satisfaction),\n              \"Staff Morale (monthly avg)\" = mean(staff_morale)) %>%\n    mutate(service = gsub(\"_\", \" \", service)) %>%\n    melt(id.var = c(\"service\", \"month\"))  %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = value, color = service)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_wrap(~ variable, scale = \"free\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n          legend.justification = \"left\",\n          legend.title = element_blank()) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq_along(month.abb), labels = month.abb) +\n    labs(title = \"Monthly Trends in Key Metrics\", x = \"\", y = \"\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-05T21:40:38.271862Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-05T21:40:38.273211Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-05T21:40:38.819402Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-05T21:40:38.817567Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"While these charts demonstrate clear and significant variation in performance metrics over the course of the year, there are no clear trends in these variations at this stage in the analysis.\n\nNext, we visualize the distribution of all four key metrics across hospital services.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# BOXPLOTS OF KEY METRICS\n\nservices_weekly %>%\n    select(service, utilization_rate, percent_patients_refused, \n           patient_satisfaction, staff_morale) %>%\n    mutate(service = gsub(\"_\", \" \", service)) %>%\n    rename(\"Utilization Rate\" = utilization_rate,\n           \"Patients Refused Services (percent)\" = percent_patients_refused,\n           \"Patient Satisfaction\" = patient_satisfaction,\n           \"Staff Morale\" = staff_morale) %>%\n    melt(id.var = \"service\") %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = service)) +\n    geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +\n    facet_wrap(~ variable, scale = \"free\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n          legend.position = \"top\",\n          legend.justification = \"left\",\n          legend.title = element_blank()) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n    labs(title = \"Distribution of Key Metrics Across Hospital Services\", \n         x = \"\", y = \"\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-05T21:31:43.863880Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-05T21:31:43.865443Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-05T21:31:44.891758Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-05T21:31:44.889934Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These boxplots reveal the following insights.\n* Utilization rate was consistently quite high.

However, metric 1 (bed utilization rate) emerged as an area of critical concern. Metric 2 (patients refused service) is another potential area for improvement. Emergency services showed especially poor performance in these metrics, and performance worsened across all services during flu epidemics.\n\nAccordingly, we make the following recommendations to hospital administration:\n1. Take steps to better prepare for flu season (typically October through May)\n    * Anticipate a higher volumne of patient requests during flu epidemic events\n    * Allocate resources to increase staffing and bed availability during flu epidemic events\n2. Take steps to lower bed utilization year-round\n    * Aim for a utilization rate under 85%\n    * Research strategies for improving resource management and allocation\n3. Take steps to improve outcomes in emergency services\n    * Allocate more resources to emergency services to lower critically high bed utilization rates\n    * Optimize patient flow in emergency services\n    * Expedite care for lower-acuity patients to decrease the number of patients refused service","metadata":{}}]}
